# All about Prompt Engineering
A-Z Prompt Engineering 

## Introduction
Welcome to "All about Prompt Engineering" - a comprehensive repository dedicated to the art and science of prompt engineering. This resource is designed to provide you with a deep understanding of prompt engineering, its applications, and best practices.

## Here is my personal Prompt Formula that I use: 

### 1. Role-Task-Example 
Step 1. Give it a role (Eg- You are an expert Product Manager with more than X years of experience)
Step 2: Give it the task you want to do 
Step 3: Give an example output for it to give you a similar output.

### 2. After every prompt write the following: "Take a deep breath and Make sure to think step by step and answer only when sure in a structured manner" 
Proven way to get a better output. Trust me it works.

### 3. Studies have shown that LLMs enhanced with prompts like “This is important for my career” or “You better be sure” give more accurate & subjectively better answers!
